This program is a streaming application where each user can create up to five profiles, select the latest, most popular and voted series or manually search for one in the dedicated gap. It was written in Java and it uses the JavaFX framework.
This was made in around 10 days, I initially lost everything but then recoded it in around 6 days. There are some things missing, but my goal wasn't to finish it but to learn how to use bindings in JavaFX, in fact the application can be resized without glitching the UI.
I first abandoned the project because of legal problems, now I didn't want to throw everything away so I created this repository to showcase it.

###### The starting page, which leads to the profile's page
